Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project

This app is for connecting users who have problems and need a fix from service providers 
like electricians, plumbers, carpenters, mechanics etc. associated with this platform. 
Clients will be able to select a service category from a list and then choose a service 
provider based on ratings and location, the service provider will arrive at the Client 
location at a scheduled time and render services.
